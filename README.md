# Health Insurance Premium Prediction

## Description
This **machine learning project** predicts health insurance premiums based on individual demographics and health characteristics. The models are trained using different Jupyter notebooks for optimized predictions across various age groups.

## Project Structure
- **`premium_prediction.ipynb`**: Model training for all age groups.
- **`premium_prediction_young.ipynb`**: Model training specifically for individuals aged 18-25.
- **`premium_prediction_rest.ipynb`**: Model training for individuals aged above 25.

## Installation
To set up your local environment to run this project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have **Python** installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
`pip install -r app/requirements.txt`


## Required Software and Tools
- **Python**: Primary programming language used.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For making statistical graphics.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **XGBoost**: Optimized distributed gradient boosting library.
- **Statsmodels**: For statistical modeling, testing, and analysis.
- **Streamlit**: Used to create and run the web application.

## Usage
To interact with the predictive models through a user-friendly web interface, run:
`python app/main.py`

After running the command, visit the local server address typically at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your web browser.
